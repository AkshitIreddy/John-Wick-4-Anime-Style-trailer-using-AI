I’ve been a huge fan of the John wick series, and i’ve always wondered how the John Wick movies would look like if they were an anime, so i decided to create an anime-style version of the John Wick 4 trailer using AI. It was an exciting challenge, and I’m thrilled to share the results with you all!

This project was pretty exciting and got me thinking about how rapidly AI has been advancing in the past few years and that one day we might be able to switch seamlessly between different visual styles, just like turning on subtitles in a YouTube video!
